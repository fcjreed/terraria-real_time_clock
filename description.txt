Are you tired of fixing your inventory after you die in mediumcore? Me too... use this mod.
Are you so obssessed with the game that you lose track of real world time? Me too... so what? Now you can see it.

Hotkey:

"Home" - Used to enable/disable death cache. When death cache is true and you die, it saves your inventory. By default this value is true, however, when you die this value becomes false. 
Once you recover your items, press the hotkey to set it back to true so when you die, it works again. This will also display the current status.

The above hotkey was added as a safety measure in case of subsequent deaths prior to picking up items.

Note: If your hotkey is not displaying a message when you press it, make sure to check your key bindings.

Thanks:

The code behind displaying the time was inspired by GoodPro712's FlightTimer Mod.

Caveats:

1. If you have a full inventory when you go to pick up your body, this mod will not do anything as your inventory is full.

2. This mod does not work properly with players who have the same name. 

TLDR:

When you pick up your items after death, this mod puts everything back the way it was in your inventory right before you died.
